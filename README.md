# Reinforcement Learning with Tensorflow
This is a series of tutorials about Reinforcement Learning implemented by Tensorflow.  
These tutorials don't aim to reproduce the methods used in the original papers, but for algorithms in a quite easy version.  
Generally they are for learning and basic understanding, but not production.

## Algorithms
1. Tabular Q Learning
2. Sarsa
3. [DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)  
4. [Double DQN](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/pdf/nature14236.pdf)  
5. [Double DQN 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) 
6. [Double DQN with Portional Preoritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)

More will be updated in the near future.   

## Dependency:  
1.Python3  
2.Tensorflow  
3.gym  
4.numpy  
5.matplotlib

## Setup and Run

    git clone https://github.com/wangshuailong/reinforcement_learning_with_Tensorflow.git  
    cd DQN (Or other folds you want)
